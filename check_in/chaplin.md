## Problem

Charlie works for an analog ad agency, West End Advertising, that helps companies market their products. He wants to be able to inform his clients how products are being portrayed in the new fancy nickelodeon, giphy.com.

## Requirements

In a client meeting, Charlie details the following:

> I want to be able to input a given product or a brand and see some gifs from giphy.com that match my search term. This way I can get a snapshot of how people are relating to my client's products.

## Tips

A developer friend of yours has given you the following tips for interacting with the Giphy API

- "Giphy's API uses a beta key that everyone has acess to, so be sure to use it while developing your app"

- "Giphy's documentation is on github, which is probably 90ish years ahead of now!"

## Spec

As always, please create a simple feature spec for this app.

## Deliverables

Create a new repo on github with your app and all associated files. Include a readme with your spec.

## Criteria

* App meets client requirements
* Every piece of code has a reason to be there - ie, it helps solve a problem
* All code is properly indented and all names (variables, routes, html attrs) are semantic

## Bonus

In a follow up phone call, Charlie mentions:

> ...if you have the time, I would like to be able to bookmark or 'pin' pictures from search terms. Sometimes I'll want to reference a particular gif in my report to clients as an example.
